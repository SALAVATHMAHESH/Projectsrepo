This C++ program calculates the area of various geometric shapes. It provides a simple and interactive way for users to input the dimensions of a shape and get its area.

## Features

* Calculates the area of the following shapes:
    * Circle
    * Rectangle
    * Triangle
    * Square
* User-friendly command-line interface.
* Clear input prompts and output.
* Basic input validation to handle non-numeric input (optional, but recommended).
* Well-structured and easy-to-understand C++ code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
* A terminal or command prompt

### Compilation

1.  Save the C++ source code in a file named `area_calculator.cpp` (or any other `.cpp` extension).
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Compile the code using the following command:

    ```bash
    g++ area_calculator.cpp -o area_calculator
    ```

    (Replace `g++` with your compiler command if it's different.)

### Running the Program

After successful compilation, you can run the program using:

```bash
./area_calculator
